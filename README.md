# Project Overview
This project, titled DATA3888_image_4, focuses on cell image analysis and model development for classification tasks. The project involves several steps, including generating cell images from a Tif file, data cleaning and preprocessing, model development and evaluation, integrating model outputs with other omics data, and deployment of Shiny Apps.

# Generating Cell Images
To generate cell images, use the "Generate_Images.Rmd" file provided in this repository. This script will create cell images and organize them in a hierarchical folder structure.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing & Splitting data into Train-validation and test in 80:20 ratio
Using "Data_Preprocessing.Rmd", and make sure this file is in same directory path as the Biotechnology folder

# Model Development and Evaluation
Read the provided ipynb files to access the code and documentation for model development and evaluation. These files contain the necessary information to understand the models and their performance.

# Integrating Model Outputs
To integrate the output of the models with other omics data, follow the instructions provided in the project documentation. This step is crucial for deploying the models effectively and obtaining meaningful insights.

# Deployment of Shiny Apps
To deploy the Shiny Apps successfully, ensure that you have the "Shiny_Apps.Rmd" files in the same directory as the "Shiny_Output" folder. The "Shiny_Output" folder contains the output files of the eight models. This setup will enable the Shiny Apps to access and utilize the model outputs.

For more detailed instructions and code explanations, refer to the individual files and documentation provided within this repository.
